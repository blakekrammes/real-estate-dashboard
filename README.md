# Real Estate Dashboard


1. Create a new React App using create-react-app to serve as the basis for the Real Estate Dashboard described above. 
   ~5 minutes

2. Override the fetch API with a custom function that returns data from JSON objects to mimic fetching data from a remote REST API. The static data is available in house_sales. ~30 minutes

3. Add a Town selector dropdown with the available towns that can be selected from. ~105 minutes

4. Using AG Grid, display a list of House Sales for the selected Town. ~35 minutes

5. Using Nivo create a scatter plot that plots the % Premium ((Sold Price - List Price) / List Price * 100) versus Closed Date to show the trend of home premiums over time. The data for this grid should also be filtered on selected Town (from #3). ~65 minutes
